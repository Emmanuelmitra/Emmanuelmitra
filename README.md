WORK EXPERIENCE	 		

Feb’22 – Present | Data Scientist | Capgemini, Bengaluru
Key Result Areas:
•	Collaborating with multi-disciplinary teams to understand business requirements for the products and projects
•	Analyzing statistical data; importing data from multiple sources, joining datasets, cleaning & preprocessing, data wrangling and visualizations
•	Identifying and implementing statistical models including linear models, multivariate analysis, stochastic models, sampling, optimization and time series analysis
•	Diagnosing bugs and data flow issues - reviewing old code to ensure that data is flowing correctly and fixing when the issues arise
•	Employing Machine Learning algorithms for classification (SVM, decision trees, random forest, and naïve Bayes), regression (linear and logistic), and clustering (k-means and hierarchical)

Projects Name: Market Stress Testing Platform
Project Description: To build a stress testing platform to evaluate the resilience of financial portfolios to market variations using PySpark, SQL & Python
•	Employed Machine Learning and statistical models to simulate market conditions and assess portfolio risk; optimized the performance of the platform by fine-tuning the model hyperparameters
•	Evaluated the platform performance and making improvements; ensuring delivering of valuable insights into portfolio risk along with aided financial institutions make informed investment decisions under varying market conditions


Project Name: Named Entity Recognition from Medical Journals
Project Description: It is very time consuming to go through all the medical articles and papers and find out what are the entities used in them to make it easier. Aim was to build a model based on transformer to summarize entities in tabular form for better analysis using Spacy, Med7 trained model
•	Applied Machine Learning and deployment of models
•	Constructed data sets by understanding the purpose of the data and the story it is going to tell
